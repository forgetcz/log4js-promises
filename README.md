# log4js-promises

This is a next possible conversion of the log4j framework to work with node. It is a also alternative for original template for this project [log4js](https://github.com/stritti/log4js). Main differences between [log4js](https://github.com/stritti/log4js) and this project is, that this is full [promised] based and strongly typed project (minimize of using any) full ready for esnext.

The documentation is not available yet.

Internal implementation of appenders:

-   console
-   file
-   std-err
-   loglevel
-   custom

Example of custom appenders is here:

-   [log4js-appender-google-hangout]()
-   [log4js-db-mongodb-esnext]
